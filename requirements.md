## Project: SmritiSetu – A Bridge Between Generations


## 1. Problem Statement

India possesses a vast repository of indigenous knowledge preserved through oral traditions, including folk stories, agricultural practices, traditional medicine, rituals, and local histories. This knowledge is primarily transmitted verbally across generations and remains largely undocumented.

Rapid modernization, migration of younger generations, declining use of native languages, and the absence of accessible digital preservation tools have placed this oral heritage at risk of permanent loss. Existing digital systems are predominantly text-centric and unsuitable for non-literate or semi-literate communities.

Once lost, oral knowledge cannot be accurately reconstructed, leading to irreversible cultural erosion.


## 2. Project Objective

The objective of SmritiSetu is to design an AI-powered platform that enables the collection, understanding, structuring, and long-term preservation of India’s oral heritage.

The system aims to bridge generational and digital divides by allowing community members to contribute knowledge through voice-based interactions in their native languages, transforming unstructured narratives into structured, searchable knowledge artifacts.


## 3. Scope of the System

### 3.1 In Scope
- Voice-based recording of oral narratives
- Support for multiple Indian regional languages
- Automated speech-to-text transcription
- AI-driven semantic analysis and categorization
- Secure storage of audio, transcripts, and metadata
- Search and retrieval of preserved knowledge

### 3.2 Out of Scope
- Medical diagnosis or prescriptive healthcare advice
- Legal consultation or case-specific legal guidance
- Commercial monetization of collected cultural knowledge



## 4. Target Users

- Village elders and traditional storytellers
- Tribal and rural community members
- NGO workers and cultural facilitators
- Researchers and educational institutions



## 5. User Personas

### 5.1 Village Elder
An elderly community member who shares stories, traditions, and experiences verbally in a native language and may have limited literacy or technical familiarity.

### 5.2 Community Facilitator
An NGO worker or volunteer who assists in recording, validating, and organizing oral narratives.

### 5.3 Researcher or Educator
An academic or student who accesses preserved knowledge for research, education, or cultural documentation.



## 6. Functional Requirements

- The system shall allow users to record oral narratives using voice input.
- The system shall support multiple Indian regional languages.
- The system shall convert speech input into text using AI-based transcription.
- The system shall analyze transcribed text to identify key themes and concepts.
- The system shall categorize narratives into structured knowledge domains.
- The system shall store original audio recordings alongside processed text.
- The system shall tag each knowledge artifact with relevant metadata such as region, language, and theme.
- The system shall provide semantic search capabilities across stored knowledge.
- The system shall maintain records of contributor consent.


## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Scalability
The system should support increasing volumes of audio and text data without degradation in performance.

### 7.2 Performance
The system should provide acceptable response times for search and retrieval operations.

### 7.3 Availability
The system should ensure high availability of stored data and services.

### 7.4 Security
The system should enforce secure storage, access control, and data protection mechanisms.

### 7.5 Reliability
The system should ensure durability and long-term preservation of cultural data.


## 8. Ethical and Social Considerations

- Explicit consent must be obtained from contributors prior to recording.
- Ownership of cultural knowledge remains with the originating community.
- The system must prevent unauthorized modification or misuse of content.
- Cultural sensitivity must be maintained during processing and presentation.


## 9. Constraints and Assumptions

- Variability in dialects and accents may affect transcription accuracy.
- Internet connectivity in rural regions may be limited.
- Initial language support may not cover all dialects.


## 10. Success Criteria

- Successful recording and transcription of oral narratives.
- Accurate thematic categorization of knowledge.
- Ease of access for non-literate users.
- Acceptance and adoption by community facilitators and researchers.

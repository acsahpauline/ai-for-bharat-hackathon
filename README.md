SmritiSetu – Preserving India’s Oral Heritage with AI

SmritiSetu is an AI-powered platform developed under the AWS AI for Bharat initiative to preserve India’s indigenous and generational knowledge by capturing oral histories in native languages. The system converts spoken narratives into structured, searchable digital knowledge using speech-to-text and generative AI.

By bridging elders and future generations, SmritiSetu safeguards cultural memory while enabling access for education, research, and policy-driven learning.
